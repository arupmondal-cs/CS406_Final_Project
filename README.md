# CS406_Final_Project (SPAM FILTER)
**Unstructured Information Processing Final Project**

In recent times, unwanted commercial bulk emails called spam has become a huge problem on theinternet.   Spam  prevents  the  user  from  making  full  and  good  use  of  time,  storage  capacity  andnetwork bandwidth. 

Machine learning methods of recent are being used to successfully detect and filter spam emails. Majority of the email spam filtering methods uses text categorization approaches. Consequently, spam filters perform poorly and cannot efficiently prevent spam mails from getting to the inbox of the users. In this project mainly we focused the Random Forests (RF) algorithm to extract important features from emails, and classify the emails into either spam or non-spam. In this section we will review some of the most popular machine learning methods that have been applied to spam detection.
